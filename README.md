Hey all I just wanted to make this github repository so I can post my most recent materials I make in Gtag here.
If you need help importing this file you need:
1. To UNZIP with WINRAR
2. Look for your Gtag directory
3. Navigate to your material folder by going through
\another-axiom-gorilla-tag\BepInEx\plugins\GorillaCosmetics\Materials
4. Go into the unziped Fading'sMaterialCollection folder and drag all the materials into the GorillaCosmetics material folder
And that should be it, if you have any material sugestions DM me on discord @ fading#3003.
